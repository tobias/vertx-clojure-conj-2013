# Developing asynchronous polyglot applications with Vert.x

The source for the presentation and demo app from my Clojure/Conj 2013
presentation.

See <http://tcrawley.org/presentations/vertx-conj-2013/vertx.html> for
the slides, and `rivulet/` for the source for the demo.

I'll update this README with a link to the recording once it is
released.
